# <Thrifty Travel>

## Description

We created Thrifty Travel to create a solution for a subject that we all have an interest in, which is travel. We set out to create a website that would reccommend a travel destination based on the user's preferences, and populate hotel and activity suggestions based on that destination. We learned to use modals in JavaScript for the quiz portion, tailwind for the CSS portion, and APIs for the hotel and activity suggestions. 


## Installation

The Thrifty Travel application is designed to be used via web browser on a computer or mobile device.

## Usage

A user can access the website via https://tonialtendorf.github.io/Thrifty-Travel/.

## User Story

So that my client can take a quiz and receive customized travel suggestions based off of their result

## Acceptance Criteria
